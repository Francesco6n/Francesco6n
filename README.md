# About me
## What do you do for a living?
In my professional life, I work in industrial automation. 
I am a PLC programmer and currently program in ST, LADDER, SFC, C, and C++.
I also program Fanuc robots and, in general, I am capable of programming everything.
I am an electrical designer and use Elettracad for drafting electrical schematics. In the past, I have also used Eplan.
Recently, I started designing and building small machines with Fusion360.

## What do you do in your private life?
In my private life, I'm a nerd and a gamer. I've invested over 1000 hours in Elden Ring, I love soulslike games and classic RPGs. 
I enjoy drawing and 3D printing, and I own a fantastic Elegoo Neptune 4 Max. 
I built a portable battery-powered PS4 and sent the prototype to America for a review. 
I'm also a mechanic and have fully restored my BMW E36 in my garage. I have a thorough understanding of how car engines and electronics work, and I've often solved impossible problems. 
For my E36, I built a control unit for the convertible top based on a 12V Siemens Logo.

## What are your goals?
**To make everything simpler**. 
I am a person who belongs to the autism spectrum, and the world, for us, is really too complicated. 
When I write my codes or create my projects, they have only one goal: to work well and be simple. 

**Simple does not mean empty**. 

When I first wrote a code for palletizing management in 2019, it turned out to be very complex. 
Indexed registers copied to other indexed registers, calculations upon calculations to determine the position of objects on the pallet, and coordinates for the clearances. 
All of this is not simple in itself but is simple in its use. In fact, you just need to pass to the code how many objects are on the pallet, determine any exclusions, and it does everything. 

It is not a simple code, but it is simple to use.

## Any interesting facts about you?
**I am very interested in psychology**. 
I practice introspection every day. 
Managing and recognizing one's emotions is fundamental in life, and as a schematic person, it is also very difficult. 
I have read hundreds of books and have been in therapy for a long time. 
I am not ashamed of it and encourage all my acquaintances to embark on a journey of self-discovery.

**I hate social networks**. 
I am deeply convinced that social networks have ruined humanity and continue to do so. 
In my mind, a society can only function if divided into smaller communities, each with its strengths and weaknesses. 
Every community is a world unto itself. But social networks have united everyone, for better or worse, and this is causing a lot of harm. 
Universe 25 teaches us a lot about this story.

**I love progress but hate education**. 
In the past, humans invented many useful things for humanity, tools and services that could help everyone in daily life. 
Just think of Nikola Tesla, who, on his own, invented the 21st century. 
This growth process stopped when we started to know "everything" about the world. 
Today's education is delivered to young people in a "sedative" way, dampening their desire to discover and invent because so much has already been done. 
Nikola Tesla did not invent alternating current; he discovered it because he saw the limitations of Thomas Edison's direct current. 
Nikola Tesla invented the neon light because he saw the limitations of the incandescent bulb. 
Nikola Tesla also discovered radio waves for signal transmission because he saw the limitations of wired communications.

And so on..

If Nikola Tesla lived today, he would not have learned anything because we are always taught that everything works well as it is. 
They put us to sleep.
**Ignorance creates inventiveness; education creates a poverty of ideas**.
